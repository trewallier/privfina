# Product Catalog

This catalog tracks product specs across supported families. The active schema is `specVersion: v2alpha1` (ADR 0020). Schema v1 / `v1alpha1` is frozen.

## Migration Statuses

These statuses track the rollout of the spec-driven product model (ADR 0013–0016):

- **spec-only**: Product spec exists, but frontend and calculations are not yet driven from it.
- **inputs-driven**: Frontend inputs are driven from spec, but calculations are not fully aligned yet.
- **calc-aligned**: Calculations are aligned to the product spec, but the full product is not yet fully spec-backed end-to-end.
- **fully-spec-backed**: Product spec, frontend inputs, calculations, and examples are all aligned and treated as the main source of truth.

Statuses are transitional rollout markers reflecting current integration state, not completion guarantees.

## Planned catalog extensions (schema-ready, not yet authored)

Schema v2 can express products such as `otp-1x1`, `otp-zold`, `vegig-fix`, `csok-plusz`, `falusi-csok`, `otthon-start`, and `videki-otthonfelujitasi` via `productCode`, subsidy/fee/discount blocks, loan purposes, and eligibility rules. Authoring those product folders is a follow-on roadmap item.
